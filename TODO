* Importance: high

** DONE implement rule matching
** DONE documentation + github
** DONE implement OpenAPI definitions for the REST API and use auto-generated request routing in L7mpController
** DONE implement stream debugging (Logger, Echo)
** TODO session setup retries/timeout
** TODO sync cluster (allow sessions to sync at a cluster)
** TODO stream statistics
** TODO expose statistics to prometheus (prometheus_listener)
** TODO expose statistics to rules matching (this would allow simple qos/rate-limiting)

* Importance: minor

** TODO JSON schema validation for JSONPredicate rules

* Test

** TODO connection/stream disconnect (currently losing a WebSocket stream along a chain does not disconnect the session)
** TODO stream segmentation correctness (do datagram streams correctly maintain message boundaries)?
